Predicting Net Revenue For Buffer is my final project at Metis. 

Buffer is a software startup founded in 2010. It has developed a popular social media management application also callded Buffer.

I found Buffer very interesting because it is highly transparent! Buffer publishes all of its KPIs such as employees' salaries, revenues, number of new customers, etc. on its website where I scraped data for my project.

In this project, I trained time series models:

• Scraped data from Buffer’s website

• Checked autocorrelation and stationarity for the net revenue data and then took weekly average and did log transformation to reduce trend and seasonality

• Performed time series model SARIMA and optimized the model to predict net revenue for 36 weeks in 2019

• Applied SARIMAX model with coupons as an exogenous variable to predict net revenue
