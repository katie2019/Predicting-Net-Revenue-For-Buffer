Predicting Net Revenue For Buffer is my final project at Metis. In this project, I used time series models to predict net revenue for Buffer.

Buffer is a software startup founded in 2010. It has developed a popular social media management application also callded Buffer.

I found Buffer very interesting because it is highly transparent! Buffer publishes all of its KPIs such as employees' salaries, revenues, number of new customers, etc. on its website where I scraped data for my project.

Language: Python

Model: statsmodels
